- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @branhammattie-cyber
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Cybersecurity Program Lead positions! I love where the technical meets communication.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about CISA certification. Even if I'm not looking into GRC positions, having the ability to audit systems effectively is an asset to any organization I go into!

- âš¡ Fun fact: In my free time I love being outdoors. Anything that our family can do to spend more time outside, we're doing! We love kayaking, camping, backpacking, hiking, white water rafting, biking, and everything in between!

If you are looking for an individual who can help your organization buy into risk mitigation and move towards a more mature security posture, I'm your gal!
